## Flare Hardhat Starter Kit

**IMPORTANT!!**
The supporting library uses Openzeppelin version `4.9.3`, be careful to use the documentation and examples from that library version.

### Getting started

If you are new to Hardhat please check the [Hardhat getting started doc](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)

1. Clone and install dependencies:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter.git
   cd flare-hardhat-starter
   ```

   and then run:

   ```console
   yarn
   ```

   or

   ```console
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up `.env` file

   ```console
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

3. Change the `PRIVATE_KEY` in the `.env` file to yours

4. Compile the project

    ```console
    yarn hardhat compile
    ```

    or

    ```console
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

    This will compile all `.sol` files in your `/contracts` folder. It will also generate artifacts that will be needed for testing. Contracts `Imports.sol` import MockContracts and Flare related mocks, thus enabling mocking of the contracts from typescript.

5. Run Tests

    ```console
    yarn hardhat test
    ```

    or

    ```console
    npx hardhat test
    ```

6. Deploy

    Check the `hardhat.config.ts` file, where you define which networks you want to interact with. Flare mainnet & test network details are already added in that file.

    Make sure that you have added API Keys in the `.env` file

   ```console
   npx hardhat run scripts/tryDeployment.ts
   ```
